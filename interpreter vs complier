 Interpreter vs Compiler in Python
Feature	                  Interpreter	                                               Compiler
Definition	        Translates and executes code line by line	                  Translates the entire code into machine code at once
Usage in Python	    Python uses an interpreter by default	                      Python code is also compiled to bytecode, but not to native machine code
Speed	              Slower (executes one line at a time)	                      Faster (executes precompiled bytecode)
Error Handling	    Stops at the first error	                                  Detects all errors in the whole program before running
Output	            No permanent file created (unless explicitly compiled)	    Creates a .pyc (bytecode) file
Execution	          Directly executes .py files	                                Compiles to .pyc files that are then interpreted by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM)
Examples	          Python (CPython, PyPy), JavaScript	                        C, C++, Java (compiles to bytecode, like Python)
