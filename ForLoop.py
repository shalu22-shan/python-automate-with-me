What is a for loop?

A for loop in Python is used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times.

It works with sequences like range, lists, strings, tuples, etc.

pattern is
for variable in range(start, end):

    sum of 2 numbers using for loop
        sum = 0
        for i in range(1, 6):
            sum = sum + i
        print("Sum =", sum)
